## üí≥ Fintech Lead Acquisition & Referral Program
*Accelerating verified investor growth through referral-driven automation and personalized reactivation*

**Client:** Funding Souq ‚Äî Fintech Investment Platform (Conceptual Project)  
**Objective:** Increase verified investor sign-ups and first-time investments while lowering customer acquisition costs through an automated referral program.

---

### 1. The Challenge

Funding platforms like Funding Souq often face:

- High drop-off between sign-up and KYC verification
- No structured referral program to leverage investor networks
- Generic follow-ups that don‚Äôt nudge verification or sharing
- No unified view of referral performance or investor acquisition

Impact: lost opportunities for **organic growth** and **first-time investments**.

## 2. Strategy ‚Äî Referral + Activation System

**Target Segments:**
- **New High-Intent Visitors:** Viewed ‚ÄúFor Investors‚Äù page multiple times; potential for first-time investment.
- **Trial / Partial-Verifiers:** Signed up but didn‚Äôt complete KYC; prime for referral nudges. 
- **Verified Users (Potential Advocates):** Completed KYC and made their first investment; can refer friends.

**Channels & Tools:**
Viral Loops (referral engine) ¬∑ Klaviyo (emails & onboarding) ¬∑ GA4 & Looker Studio (tracking & reporting) ¬∑ Meta & LinkedIn Ads (retargeting) ¬∑ Typeform (demo KYC/investment)

**Methods:**
- Two-sided referral rewards: Both referrer and referee earn incentives, triggered by first qualifying investment.
- Automated referral flow: Viral Loops handles link sharing, tracking and notifications.
- Onboarding nudges: Progressive prompts guide users to complete KYC and make their first investment.
- MVP-first demo: Proof-of-concept using Viral Loops + manual tracking (Google Sheets/Zapier) before full integration.
- Performance measurement: Track referral ‚Üí KYC ‚Üí first investment to quantify CAC reduction and new capital inflow.
